1st International Conference on NextGen VLSI & Communication
Technologies (ICNVCT 2025)
About University:
Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation (KLEF) Deemed to be university was established in
1980-81, as KL College of Engineering, which was upgraded to KL College of Engineering
Autonomous in 2006 by UGC, and was declared as a Deemed to be University in 2009 by UGC,
MHRD Government of India. In 2019
UGC, MHRD declared this intuition as Category I Institution. The frist off campus, has come up
in A.Y 2018-2019 at Hyderabad, Moinabad, Aziznagar Road, near TSPA Junction, on the road
leading to Chilkur Balaji temple. KLEF Deemed to be University has inaugurated its second off
campus in A.Y. 2023-2024 in Bowrampet Village, Medchal, Malkajgiri District, Greater
Hyderabad. KLEF (Deemed to be University) offers outstanding undergraduate, postgraduate and
doctoral programmes in engineering and management streams from two campuses Vijayawada
and Hyderabad. KLEF has established an ecosystem to promote innovation, including a centre for
Innovation, Incubation and Entrepreneurship Cell (IIEC), leading to start-ups in different
disciplines. Through publishing research articles in various national and international refereed
journals, particularly in Scopus/WoS/SCI Indexed journals, research has taken a quantum leap
towards improving its quality, resulting in good h-index.
About ECE Department:
The department of Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) is started in the year 2023
which offers undergraduate program (B.Tech.), and Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy) with well
experienced faculty who contribute immensely for the all-round development of students of the
Department. ECE is a broad engineering field with sub fields - Analog/Digital electronics, VLSI,
4G/5G, Radio and Satellite Communications, Embedded systems, Signal & Image Processing,
Robotics, IOT, Smart Cities, Edge Computing, AI, Quantum Circuitry, Nano-electronics,
Photonics, Renewable Energy and many others. The ECE discipline utilizes various simulation,
algorithms and fabrication tools to develop active/passive electrical devices that include diodes,
transistors, semiconductors, and integrated circuits, etc to aid in design and fabrication of
electronic circuits, devices, VLSI devices, PCB, Nano-devices and their various application
systems.
About ICNVCT 2025:
The International Conference on NextGen VLSI & Communication Technologies (ICNVCT
2025) aims to provide a comprehensive platform for researchers, academicians, and industry
professionals to exchange innovative ideas and present their latest research findings in the field of
electronics and communication engineering. With a broad scope, ICNVCT 2025 will cover a
diverse range of topics, including electronics, VLSI systems, signal processing, wireless
communication systems, and embedded systems. The conference seeks to foster collaboration and
knowledge sharing among participants, playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of these rapidly
evolving fields. ICNVCT 2025 will feature keynote talks by distinguished speakers from renowned
institutions, alongside technical sessions for paper presentations. Researchers are encouraged to
submit original contributions addressing current trends and challenges in electronics,
communications, signal processing, VLSI and embedded systems. Through this exchange,
ICNVCT 2025 aims to advance the frontiers of these disciplines and inspire future developments.
ICNVCT is organized by Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, KL
University, Bachupally Campus, Hyderabad
